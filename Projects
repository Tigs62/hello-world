Hi Again,
This is my list of Projects that i have in mind.  Some are for work, some for home and some are for Diabetes.

Diabetes:
  - Small Bg display
  This is going to be a small, inexspenive display to show current Blood Glucose readings
    Specifications:
    -Small
    -Inexpensive
    -Easy to use
    -Portable
    -Battery powered
    -Easy to programme
  
  - Wall Bg Display
  This is similar to the above, except i want it to be larger and have an audible alarm.  I work in an office on my own, and sometimes i don't see anyone for many hours.  I want a wall mounted monitor in another room, so my colleagues can see if i am ok.

Work
  - Multiple Temperature Sensors
  These will be to allow me to log the temperature in our factory, at different heights and over the large floor area.
  The intention is to use something like the ESP32 microcontroller and multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors.
  Specification
  -Small
  -Inexpensive
  -Easy to use
  -Mains or PoE powered
  
  I also want to be able to Log the temperature data and view it on a webpage.
  To do this, i think i will use a Raspberry Pi with an attached Hard Disk Drive, maybe in a 2.5" format.
